#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering systematicaly applies engineering methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Artificial intelligence that have led to the automation of repititive tasks.
2. Object oriented programming making code reusable.
3. Agile methodoly of software development resulting in faster development and customer satisfaction.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning - the project’s scope, objectives, resources, timeline, and budget are defined.
2. Requirements Analysis - detailed requirements are gathered from stakeholders.
3. Design - based on the requirements, the system architecture and design are created.
4. Implementation - developers write the actual code based on the design documents.
5. Testing - developed software undergoes thorough testing to identify and fix defects or bugs.
6. Deployment and Maintenance of Products - the conclusive product is released in phases as per the organization’s strategy. Then it is tested in a real industrial environment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Waterfall follows a strict sequence of phases: Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance. Each phase must be completed before the next begins, and there’s little room for revisiting earlier phases. Waterfall is ideal for building a Large-Scale Enterprise System.
2. Agile divides the project into small, manageable iterations (sprints), each delivering a potentially shippable product increment. The process is cyclical and allows for continuous feedback and adaptation. Agile is well-suited for projects like mobile app development, where user feedback is critical, and requirements may change frequently based on market trends or user feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer
Roles and Responsibilities: 
a. Design and Implementation: Software Developers are responsible for designing, coding, and implementing software applications based on the requirements provided. They write the actual code that makes up the software, ensuring it is efficient, maintainable, and scalable.
b. Debugging and Troubleshooting: They identify and fix bugs or issues in the code during development. This involves running tests, reviewing code, and optimizing performance.
c. Code Reviews: Developers often participate in code reviews, where they examine each other's code to ensure quality, adherence to coding standards, and best practices.
d. Documentation: They document the code, including writing comments within the code and creating user manuals or technical guides that explain how the software functions.
e. Collaboration: Developers work closely with other team members, including QA Engineers and Project Managers, to ensure that the software meets the specified requirements and that any issues are promptly addressed.

2. Quality Assurance Engineer
Roles and Responsibilities:
a. Testing and Validation: QA Engineers are responsible for ensuring the software meets quality standards by designing, executing, and managing various tests. This includes manual testing, automated testing, unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.
b. Bug Reporting and Tracking: They identify, report, and track defects or issues in the software, working with developers to ensure that these are fixed before the software is released.
c. Test Plan Development: QA Engineers create detailed test plans, test cases, and test scripts that outline how the software will be tested, what scenarios will be covered, and what criteria will be used to evaluate success.
d. Ensuring Compliance: They ensure that the software complies with relevant standards, regulations, and best practices, especially in industries where compliance is critical, such as healthcare or finance.
e. Continuous Improvement: QA Engineers contribute to the continuous improvement of the testing process by identifying areas where efficiency and effectiveness can be enhanced, such as by introducing new tools or methodologies.

3. Project Manager
Roles and Responsibilities:
a. Planning and Scheduling: The Project Manager (PM) is responsible for creating the project plan, which includes defining the project scope, setting timelines, allocating resources, and establishing milestones. They ensure that the project stays on schedule and within budget.
b. Team Coordination: PMs coordinate the activities of the software development team, including developers, QA engineers, designers, and other stakeholders. They facilitate communication and collaboration across the team to ensure everyone is aligned with the project goals.
c. Risk Management: They identify potential risks to the project and develop strategies to mitigate these risks. This includes anticipating issues that could derail the project and finding solutions before they become problems.
d. Stakeholder Communication: Project Managers act as the primary point of contact between the development team and external stakeholders (such as clients or upper management). They provide regular updates on project progress, address concerns, and manage expectations.
e. Quality Assurance and Delivery: While QA Engineers handle the technical aspects of quality, Project Managers ensure that the project delivers a quality product that meets the client's expectations. They oversee the final delivery and handle any issues that arise post-launch.
f. Budget and Resource Management: They manage the project's budget, ensuring that resources are used efficiently and that the project stays within financial constraints.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
a. Enhanced Productivity: IDEs provide a comprehensive set of tools and features that streamline the coding process. These include code editors, debuggers, compilers, and interpreters, all within a single interface. This integration allows developers to write, test, and debug code more efficiently, reducing the time needed to switch between different tools.
b. Code Assistance: Modern IDEs offer features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and real-time error detection. These features help developers write code faster and with fewer errors, improving overall code quality.
c. Project Management: IDEs often include project management tools that help developers organize files, manage dependencies, and configure build processes. This organization is particularly valuable in large projects with complex structures.
d. Integrated Debugging: The debugging tools within IDEs allow developers to step through code, inspect variables, and analyze the execution flow, making it easier to identify and fix issues.
e. Plugin Support: Many IDEs support plugins or extensions, enabling developers to customize their environment with additional tools and features that suit their specific needs. This flexibility can greatly enhance the development experience.
Example: Visual Studio Code.

2. Version Control Systems (VCS)
a. Collaboration: VCS allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other’s work. Developers can work on different parts of the codebase in parallel, and VCS helps merge changes from different team members.
b. Change Tracking: VCS keeps a detailed history of every change made to the codebase. This history includes who made the change, when it was made, and why. This transparency is crucial for understanding the evolution of the code and for identifying when and where issues were introduced.
c. Branching and Merging: VCS supports branching, where developers can create separate copies of the codebase to work on new features or experiments without affecting the main codebase. Once the work is complete, these branches can be merged back into the main branch, allowing for controlled integration of new features.
d. Reversion and Recovery: VCS allows developers to revert to previous versions of the code if a new change introduces bugs or issues. This ability to “roll back” to a known good state is critical for maintaining code stability.
e. Continuous Integration (CI): VCS is often integrated with CI pipelines, where code is automatically tested and deployed upon each commit. This integration ensures that the code is always in a deployable state and helps catch issues early.
Example: Git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Managing Complex and Changing Requirements
a. Prioritize Communication: Maintain regular communication with stakeholders to clarify requirements and expectations. Use tools like user stories and acceptance criteria to ensure that everyone is on the same page.
b. Implement Version Control: Use version control systems (VCS) to manage changes in code and requirements, ensuring that changes are tracked, documented, and reversible if necessary.

2. Time Management and Deadlines
a. Break Down Tasks: Decompose large tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces, and set realistic deadlines for each. This makes it easier to track progress and stay on schedule.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: Verifies individual components or units of code. Important for early bug detection and ensuring code quality.
2. Integration Testing: Tests the interaction between integrated modules. Critical for detecting issues in how components work together.
3. System Testing: Tests the complete and integrated system. Ensures that the entire system meets functional and non-functional requirements.
4. Acceptance Testing: Validates that the software meets the business needs and is ready for release. Ensures client satisfaction and product readiness.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
Importance:
1. Optimizing AI Performance:
Well-engineered prompts can guide the AI to produce more accurate, relevant, and helpful responses.

2. Disambiguation and Clarity:
Ambiguous or poorly worded prompts can lead to confusion and irrelevant outputs. Prompt engineering helps in crafting clear and specific queries that reduce ambiguity, ensuring that the AI understands the context and intent behind the question or task.

3. Customizing Responses:
Prompt engineering allows users to tailor the AI's responses to meet specific needs or preferences. For example, specifying the desired format, tone, or level of detail in the prompt can help generate responses that are more aligned with the user's expectations.

4. Mitigating Biases and Errors:
Careful prompt engineering can help mitigate biases and errors in AI responses. By framing questions in a way that reduces the likelihood of biased or inappropriate outputs, users can promote more ethical and accurate interactions with the model.

5. Efficient Problem-Solving:
In complex problem-solving scenarios, prompt engineering can help break down tasks into manageable parts, guiding the AI through a step-by-step process. This approach can lead to more effective and reliable solutions.

6. Enhancing Creativity and Exploration:
By experimenting with different prompt structures, users can explore the creative potential of AI models. Prompt engineering can be used to inspire new ideas, generate content, or explore alternative perspectives on a given topic.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Tell me about cats.
Improved prompt: Tell me about the history of domestic cats.
The improved prompt is clearer, specific and consice thus better at getting a proper response.
